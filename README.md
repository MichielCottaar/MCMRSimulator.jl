MRI comes in a wide variety of different modalities, each of which provides its own window into tissue microscture.
Because of these different sensitivities to the tissue, each MRI modality comes with its own microsctural model.
This simulator aims to combine all of these models to produce a single unified tool to model the effect of microstructure on the MRI signal evolution.
