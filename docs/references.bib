  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that there is a direct link between the orientation of the nerve fibers in white matter (WM) and the contrast observed in magnitude and phase images acquired using gradient echo MRI. Understanding the origin of this link is of great interest because it could offer access to a new diagnostic tool for investigating tissue microstructure. Since it has been suggested that myelin is the dominant source of this contrast, creating an accurate model for characterizing the effect of the myelin sheath on the evolution of the NMR signal is an essential step toward fully understanding WM contrast. In this study, we show by comparison of the results of simulations and experiments carried out on human subjects at 7T, that the magnitude and phase of signals acquired from WM in vivo can be accurately characterized by (i) modeling the myelin sheath as a hollow cylinder composed of material having an anisotropic magnetic susceptibility that is described by a tensor with a radially oriented principal axis, and (ii) adopting a two-pool model in which the water in the sheath has a reduced T(2) relaxation time and spin density relative to its surroundings, and also undergoes exchange. The accuracy and intrinsic simplicity of the hollow cylinder model provides a versatile framework for future exploitation of the effect of WM microstructure on gradient echo contrast in clinical MRI.},

  abstract = {Tremendous efforts have been made in the last decade to advance cutting-edge MRI technology in pursuit of mapping structural connectivity in the living human brain with unprecedented sensitivity and speed. The first Connectom 3T MRI scanner equipped with a 300 mT/m whole-body gradient system was installed at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 2011 and was specifically constructed as part of the Human Connectome Project. Since that time, numerous technological advances have been made to enable the broader use of the Connectom high gradient system for diffusion tractography and tissue microstructure studies and leverage its unique advantages and sensitivity to resolving macroscopic and microscopic structural information in neural tissue for clinical and neuroscientific studies. The goal of this review article is to summarize the technical developments that have emerged in the last decade to support and promote large-scale and scientific studies of the human brain using the Connectom scanner. We provide a brief historical perspective on the development of Connectom gradient technology and the efforts that led to the installation of three other Connectom 3T MRI scanners worldwide \textendash{} one in the United Kingdom in Cardiff, Wales, another in Continental Europe in Leipzig, Germany, and the latest in Asia in Shanghai, China. We summarize the key developments in gradient hardware and image acquisition technology that have formed the backbone of Connectom-related research efforts, including the rich array of high-sensitivity receiver coils, pulse sequences, image artifact correction strategies and data preprocessing methods needed to optimize the quality of high-gradient strength dMRI data for subsequent analyses. Finally, we review the scientific impact of the Connectom MRI scanner, including advances in diffusion tractography, tissue microstructural imaging, ex vivo validation, and clinical investigations that have been enabled by Connectom technology. We conclude with brief insights into the unique value of strong gradients for dMRI and where the field is headed in the coming years.},

  abstract = {An analytical method for the calculation of the magnetostatic scalar potential and the magnetic field created by a polyhedron-shaped permanent magnet is presented in this paper. The magnet is supposed to be uniformly magnetized. The magnetization is equivalent to distributions of magnetic charges: it is the coulombian approach. The analytical calculation is made by a surface integration on all the polygons that composes the polyhedron. For each polygonal surface, we have shown that it can be decomposed in a series of right triangles. An analytical solution in the particular case of the right triangle has been developed. By this way, the magnetostatic potential and the magnetic field of any polyhedral-shaped magnet can be analytically calculated.},

  abstract = {To date, numerical simulations of the brain tissue have been limited by their lack of realism and flexibility. The purpose of this work is to propose a controlled and flexible generative model for brain cell morphology and an efficient computational pipeline for the reliable and robust simulation of realistic cellular structures with application to numerical simulation of intra-cellular diffusion-weighted MR (DW-MR) signal features. Inspired by the advances in computational neuroscience for modelling brain cells, we propose a generative model that enables users to simulate molecular diffusion within realistic digital brain cells, such as neurons, in a completely controlled and flexible fashion. We validate our new approach by showing an excellent match between the morphology (no statistically different 3D Sholl metrics, P\,{$>$}\,0.05) and simulated intra-cellular DW-MR signal (mean relative difference\,{$<$}\,2\%) of the generated digital model of brain cells and those of digital reconstruction of real brain cells from available open-access databases. We demonstrate the versatility and potential of the framework by showing a select set of examples of relevance for the DW-MR community. The computational models introduced here are useful for synthesizing intra-cellular DW-MR signals, similar to those one might measure from brain metabolites DW-MRS experiments. They also provide the foundation for a more complete simulation system that will potentially include signals from extra-cellular compartments and exchange processes, necessary for synthesizing DW-MR signals of relevance for DW-MRI experiments.},

Using a spherical meshing technique which decomposes each microstructural item into a set of overlapping spheres, the phantom construction is made very fast while reliably avoiding the collisions between items in the scene. This novel method is applied to the construction of human brain white matter microstructural components, namely axonal fibers, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The algorithm reaches high values of packing density and angular dispersion for the axonal fibers, even in the case of multiple white matter fiber populations and enables the construction of complex biomimicking geometries including myelinated axons, beaded axons, and glial cells. The method can be readily adapted to model gray matter microstructure.},

  abstract = {Monte-Carlo diffusion simulations are a powerful tool for validating tissue microstructure models by generating synthetic diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI) in controlled environments. This is fundamental for understanding the link between micrometre-scale tissue properties and DW-MRI signals measured at the millimetre-scale, optimizing acquisition protocols to target microstructure properties of interest, and exploring the robustness and accuracy of estimation methods. However, accurate simulations require substrates that reflect the main microstructural features of the studied tissue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel computational workflow, CACTUS (Computational Axonal Configurator for Tailored and Ultradense Substrates), for generating synthetic white matter substrates. Our approach allows constructing substrates with higher packing density than existing methods, up to 95\% intra-axonal volume fraction, and larger voxel sizes of up to 500{$\mu$}m3 with rich fibre complexity. CACTUS generates bundles with angular dispersion, bundle crossings, and variations along the fibres of their inner and outer radii and g-ratio. We achieve this by introducing a novel global cost function and a fibre radial growth approach that allows substrates to match predefined targeted characteristics and mirror those reported in histological studies. CACTUS improves the development of complex synthetic substrates, paving the way for future applications in microstructure imaging.},
