# [Obstructions to free diffusion](@id geometry)
MCMRSimulator.jl comes with a variety of basic components that can be used to represent various components in the tissue microstructure.

The constructors for these components all have a similar interface.
Some expect certain component-specific keyword arguments (e.g., radius for [`Spheres`](@ref) and [`Cylinders`](@ref), or the keywords regarding the myelin-induced off-resonance field produced by [`Cylinders`](@ref) or [`Annuli`](@ref)).
MRI relaxation properties within the obstruction and collision parameters (stuck spins, magnetisation transfer rate & permeability) can be set using keyword arguments as described in the [properties section](@ref properties).
Finally, these constructors expect a set of keyword arguments that control their location.
These arguments are identicaly across all constructors (although the expected input depends on the dimensionality of the component as listed in the table above):
- `position`: Set the positions for each generated components (not used in [`Mesh`](@ref)).
- `repeats`: Set the distance with which all components should be repeated.
- `rotation`: Applies a single rotation to the whole system.
Components with a lower dimensionality are defined by default along the x-axis (for dimensionality of 1) or the x-y plane (for dimensionality of 2). 
In other words, the normal of the [`Walls`](@ref) point in the x-axis by default, while the [`Cylinders`](@ref) point in the z-axis.
Shifts and repeats should only be provided in this lower-dimensional space.
The `rotation` keyword can be used to define these components along other lines/planes (see [`get_rotation`](@ref)).

From the command line all of these keywords are available as flags, which can be seen by running:
```bash
mcmr geometry create walls/cylinders/annuli/spheres --help
```

In Julia, the easiest way to get the documentation for all keywords is to run:
```
?Walls/Cylinders/Annuli/Spheres/Mesh
```
or by following the links in the table above.


For example, we can create two base cylinders, which repeat infinitely by running:
```@example
using MCMRSimulator
geometry = Cylinders(radius=sqrt(0.5), position=[[0, 0], [1, 1]], repeats=[2, 2])
using CairoMakie # hide
f = plot(PlotPlane(size=4), geometry) # hide
save("regular_cylinders.png", f) # hide
nothing # hide
```

Alternatively, the same configuration could be produced with a single cylinder by providing a `rotation`.
```@example
using MCMRSimulator
rotation = [
    sqrt(0.5) sqrt(0.5) 0.
    -sqrt(0.5) sqrt(0.5) 0.
    0. 0. 1.
    ]
geometry = Cylinders(radius=sqrt(0.5), repeats=[sqrt(2), sqrt(2)], rotation=rotation)
using CairoMakie # hide
f = plot(PlotPlane(size=4), geometry) # hide
save("regular_cylinders2.png", f) # hide
nothing # hide
```

### Randomly distributed cylinders/annuli/spirals
A random set of positions and radii can be created using [`random_positions_radii`](@ref).
The user in this case sets a target density (70% in the example below) and over which length scale the configuration should repeat itself (20x20 micrometer in the example below).
```@example random_distribution
using MCMRSimulator # hide
using Random; Random.seed!(1234) # hide
(positions, outer_radii) = random_positions_radii((20, 20), 0.7, 2)
nothing # hide
```

From the command line this functionality is available by running `mcmr geometry create-random cylinders/annuli/spheres`.

These can be used to produce randomly distributed cylinders:
```@example random_distribution
geometry = Cylinders(radius=outer_radii, position=positions, repeats=(20, 20))
using CairoMakie # hide
f = plot(PlotPlane(size=20), geometry) # hide
save("random_cylinders.png", f) # hide
nothing # hide
```

When used as initialisation for annuli or spirals, an inner radius will also need to be computed:
```@example random_distribution
geometry = Annuli(inner=0.8 .* outer_radii, outer=outer_radii, position=positions, repeats=(20, 20))
using CairoMakie # hide
f = plot(PlotPlane(size=20), geometry) # hide
save("random_annuli.png", f) # hide
nothing # hide
```
