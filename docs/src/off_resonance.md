# Off-resonance field
## Off-resonance generated by myelinated cylinders
In MRSimulator.jl, the edge of the cylinders is infinitely thin, even if it is myelinated. 
Hence, the myelination does not affect the diffusion of the particles, just the off-resonance field experienced by the particles.
To still get realistic off-resonance fields, we have to slightly adjust the equations for the field generated by Wharton & Bowtell (2012).

Within the cylinder the off-resonance field the field given by Wharton & Bowtell (2012) is:
```math
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} = \frac{3}{4} \chi_A \sin^2 \theta \ln \left(\frac{r_o}{r_i}\right)
```
Given a user-defined g-ratio (``g=r_i/r_o``) this becomes:
```math
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} = -\frac{3}{4} \chi_A \sin^2 \theta \ln g = \omega_{\rm internal} \sin^2 \theta
```
where ``\omega_{\rm internal} \equiv -\frac{3}{4} \chi_A \ln g`` is precomputed when the [`Cylinder`](@ref) is created.
This is multiplied by ``\sin^2 \theta`` when callling [`off_resonance`](@ref) for the cylinder.

Outside of the cylinder the field is given by Wharton & Bowtell (2012) as:
```math
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} = \left(\chi_I + \chi_A/4 \right) \sin^2 \theta \frac{\cos 2 \phi}{2} \frac{r_0^2 - r_i^2}{r^2}
```
Here are field depends on exactly how the inner and outer radius are related with the single cylinder radius (``r_c``).
We choose ``r_c \equiv (r_i + r_o)/2``. In that case ``r_0^2 - r_i^2 = 4 * r_c^2 \frac{1 - g^2}{(1 + g)^2}`` and hence:
```math
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} = 2 \left(\chi_I + \chi_A/4 \right) \sin^2 \theta (2 \cos^2 \phi - 1) \frac{r_c^2}{r^2} \frac{1-g^2}{(1 + g)^2}
```
where we have also used ``\cos 2 \phi = (2 \cos^2 \phi - 1)``.
Once again we pre-compute most of this equation (``\omega_{\rm external} \equiv 2 \left(\chi_I + \chi_A/4 \right) r_c^2 \frac{1-g^2}{(1 + g)^2}`` when the [`Cylinder`](@ref) is created.
This is multiplied by ``\sin^2 \theta (2 \cos^2 \phi - 1) / r^2`` when callling [`off_resonance`](@ref) for the cylinder.
