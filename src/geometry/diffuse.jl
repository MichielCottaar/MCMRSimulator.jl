    correct_collision(movement, geometry)

Splits the given movement from point A to point B into multiple steps that bounce off the given obstructions.
This function assumes perfect reflection rather than the diffuse reflection used in [`draw_step`](@ref).
It is used to test the collision detection and resolution, but not actually used in the simulations.
